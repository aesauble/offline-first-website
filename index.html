    <h1>Offline First <span class="deemphasize">Development</span></h1>

    <p>Internet access is not a universal constant. But we tend
    to build apps as if it were. Let&rsquo;s address this disconnect.</p>

    <p><a href="#">Offline First App Development</a> is a book about robust
    apps. Apps which don&rsquo;t curl up and die when you pull the plug. Apps
    which are just as comfortable online as they are offline. Apps which Just
    Work&trade;.</p>
    
    <p>I assume you already know how to build mobile apps. That&rsquo;s not the
    point of this book.  My goal is to show how you can start with a 100%
    offline app (a position of strength and resiliency) and extend it to embrace
    the power of being online. You will use the following tools and services to
    achieve this:

    <ul>
      <li>PouchDB</li>
      <li>Cloudant</li>
      <li>Sencha Touch</li>
      <li>Cordova</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Designing for the worst case scenario is not a new concept, but it is
    often overlooked. The happy path is built first. Only then are exceptional
    cirumstances considered, often resulting in a major refactor or rewrite. An
    offline first approach is only one of many choices. You can design for
    security first, mobile first, accessibility first, or performance first.</p>

    <p>Offline just happens to be an area which affects everyone in a big way,
    so it&rsquo;s a reasonable place to start. I encourage you to explore those
    other approaches as well.</p>

    <p>Any book is a commitment. Here are some of the things you will learn from
    this book.

    <ul>
      <li>Learn how to use common libraries to enhance the offline experience of
      mobile apps.</li>
      <li>Understand the design principles behind a well-designed offline
      experience.</li>
      <li>Learn how to design empty states and errors that inform, not confuse.
      </li>
      <li>Learn how to create the illusion of being online when youâ€™re really
      offline.</li>
      <li>Learn how to build user trust by being transparent and setting good
      expectations.</li>
      <li>Learn how to make an application adjust gracefully to changing network
      conditions.</li>
      <li>Understand the problem of split-brain, and how to minimize its effects
      while offline.</li>
      <li>Learn how to pick an appropriate caching strategy based on your user
      scenarios.</li>
      <li>Learn about the current state of peer-to-peer networking on mobile
      devices.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>You may assume that this is a problem only fringe apps exhibit. This is
    not the case. Open Pinterest or Apple Maps. These are popular apps with
    terrible offline experiences. Data is not cached, error messages are
    ambiguous, and inconsistencies abound.</p>
    
    <p>This book is design focused. You must care about the people for which you
    are crafting an experience. Once you have empathy, you can focus on the
    right problems to solve.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike typical design books, which inspire but don&rsquo;t follow through
    with application, this book does both. You will write an app which applies
    what you learn about offline design. Or apply the lessons to your own
    applications immediately. Your choice.</p>

    <p>As you think about offline first development, a useful analogy is the
    bunker and the beach house. An offline app is like a hardened bunker,
    functional but isolated. An online app is like a beach house, open but
    vulnerable. You can combine these two approaches while retaining the
    strengths of each.</p>

    <p>The problem is that most developers build the beach house first. Often,
    retrofitting a bunker is not simple. You end up building a bunker, then
    rebuilding the beach house on top of it. Our strategy is the opposite.</p>

    <p>You start by building a fully-functional, but offline version of a todo
    app. Each chapter, I&rsquo;ll introduce a new concept which gradually makes
    the app a first-class online citizen. However, because you start at a robust
    starting point, it&rsquo;s much easier to ensure that you retain that solid
    foundation.</p>

    <p>This raises an interesting question. How do you measure robustness? There
    isn&rsquo;t a single metric to answer this question. Instead, you&rsquo; use
    a set of 10 principles of good offline design, and measure the app against
    these at regular intervals. The principles are as follows:

    <ol>
      <li>Content is mutable. Don&rsquo;t let my online/offline status change that.
      </li>
      <li>Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.
      </li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t let me start something I can&rsquo;t finish.</li>
      <li>An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest
      about it.</li>
      <li>When laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when
      caching.</li>
      <li>Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.</li>
      <li>Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don&rsquo;t be jarring.</li>
      <li>Never purge the cache unless I demand it.</li>
    </ol>
